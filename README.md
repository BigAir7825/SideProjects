# SideProjects
Overview:
===============================================================================================================================================================================
This repository is for reference of programming I do in my free time, this is not a full list of my side projects, just the ones that I need VCS for.
===============================================================================================================================================================================
KnuckleWords
===============================================================================================================================================================================
This project is borne out of an ice breaker question I heard. The question was: if you could get two 4 letter words tatooed on your knuckles what words would you pick. When asked, I wanted to use the words to make a larger word. The program takes a list of four letter words and a list of eight letter words, generates all possible eight letter words either by placing them side-to-side or interlacing them together, and checks them against the eight letter words

TestReview
===============================================================================================================================================================================
I made this program because Quizlet does not allow me to use their Tests feature more than once, which is how I usually study for vocab tests. This is a simple GUI application that prints a question and displays the answer when the user requests it, then saves harder questions to a seperate text file the user can choose to use instead
===============================================================================================================================================================================
FileSorterApplication
===============================================================================================================================================================================
This program manages my folder structure for college courses, the program takes files from a dump folder and then moves them to the correct folder based on the name of the file
===============================================================================================================================================================================
Note:
===============================================================================================================================================================================
The programming languages used in this repository are not the only languages I use, but the ones I am most comfortable with. I am most experienced with C#, so I use that langauge the most.
