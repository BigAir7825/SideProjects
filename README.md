# SideProjects

## Overview

This repository serves as a reference for the programming work I undertake during my free time. While it does not encompass all my side projects, it catalogs those for which I utilize version control systems (VCS).

# Folder Structure

The project's codebase is organized as follows:

- **FileSorterApplication**
  - **Description**: This project streamlines the management of my folder structure for college courses. This program efficiently takes files from a designated dump folder and relocates them to the correct folders based on file names.
- **InterviewPrep**
  - **Description**: This project was a method forme to study for interviews for my Highschool and early college job applications. It has a simple question and answer mechanic in the form of a CLI.
- **KnuckleWords**
  - **Description**: This project originated from an icebreaker question: "If you could have two 4-letter words tattooed on your knuckles, what words would you choose?" My response was to use these words to form a larger word. This program takes a list of four-letter words and a list of eight-letter words, generating all possible eight-letter combinations by arranging them side-by-side or interlacing them. It then checks these combinations against the provided eight-letter words.
- **TestReview**
  - **Description**: This project was created in response to the limitations of Quizlet's test feature, which can only be used once. As my preferred method for studying vocabulary tests, I developed this simple GUI application. It presents questions and displays answers when requested by the user. Furthermore, it saves more challenging questions to a separate text file, which the user can opt to use.

## Note 
These personal projects are not currently maintained and have not been so for some time, and are thus flawed and outdated.
